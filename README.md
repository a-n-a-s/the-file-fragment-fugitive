# The File Fragment Fugitive 🧩

> **A Git Arcana Challenge**

## The Challenge

### The Riddle

```
Scattered pieces tell the whole,
Like fragments of a broken scroll.
Across the repository wide,
The code is split, divided, and disguised.

Three paths diverge in a git-made wood,
Each holds a piece where understanding stood.
Find the branches that time forgot,
Assemble the fragments they quietly got.
```

Branch names hint at their order: auth → api → develop (alphabetically by purpose)
